Amazon SQS :
 
1) While sending a message to an SQS queue, you must provide the Queue URL.
 
2) While consuming a message from SQS, only the Queue Name is sufficient because the framework resolves the queue name to the URL internally.
 
3) aws sqs create-queue --queue-name my-standard-queue (to create queue name)
 
4) aws sqs get-queue-url --queue-name my-standard-queue (to get queue url)
 
5) aws sqs list-queues (list all queues)

6) What happens in SQS ?
a) Produce
b) Consume
c) Delete

7) Message retention period: 1 minute to 14 days (default is 4 days).

8) When a message is retrieved, SQS locks it temporarily (Visibility Timeout) to prevent other consumers from processing it simultaneously.

9) If processing is successful, the consumer deletes the message from the queue

10) If a message remains unprocessed beyond the Dead-letter queue (DLQ) threshold, it moves to the DLQ for debugging.

11) Default Credentials Provider: The SDK will automatically fetch credentials from the IAM instance profile attached to the EC2 instance.

12) AWS provides temporary credentials (Access Key, Secret Key, and Session Token) for the role.

13) These credentials are exposed through the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) at a specific endpoint: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/.

14) role provides temporary credentials through the AWS instance metadata service. so credentials are fetched dynamically.

15) If multiple consumers are polling from the same queue, each message is delivered to only one consumer (not all). SQS automatically distributes messages among available consumers.

16) When a consumer picks up a message, it becomes invisible to others for a set duration (visibility timeout). The consumer must delete the message after processing to prevent redelivery.

17) If a message isn’t deleted before the visibility timeout expires, it may be redelivered to another consumer. Use FIFO queues for exactly-once processing and message deduplication.
